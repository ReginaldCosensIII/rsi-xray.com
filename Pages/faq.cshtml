                    <p>
                        Our upgrade packages offer a cost-effective solution to gauge obsolescence by reusing existing measuring frames,
                        sensors, and cabling. This minimizes installation costs and downtime, with most upgrades completed in just a few days.
                        The process starts with a full evaluation of your current system to see what can be retrofitted with the latest technology.

                        Yes. Our x-ray sources and detectors are mechanically and electrically backwards compatible with those used in many older gauges,
                        including systems from DMC and Radiometrie. This allows you to benefit from improved performance while minimizing the need for
                        additional costly spare parts.

                    <p>
                        X-ray gauging is a non-contact method to measure the thickness of materials like steel and aluminum. It uses a C-frame with an x-ray source
                        in the lower arm and a detector in the upper arm. By measuring how the material absorbs the x-rays, we can determine its thickness with high
                        accuracy and speed.

                        While other manufacturers regulate beam intensity, RSI also tightly regulates beam energy. This ensures excellent long-term stability and maintains
                        accuracy without needing a large number of internal samples. Our proprietary X-ray Spectrum Correction (XSC) technique compensates for the "aging"
                        effect of components, guaranteeing that alloy correction factors do not change over the life of the gauge.
