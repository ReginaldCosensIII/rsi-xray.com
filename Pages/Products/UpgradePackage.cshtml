                    <h2>Recycle Your Old Gauge</h2>
                    <p>The computer in your gauge might be old or obsolete, but the frame and sensors are not. A system upgrade from RSI will make your aging thickness or coating gauge perform even better than when it was brand new for a fraction of the price. RSI upgrade packages offer faster measurement speeds, advanced network connectivity, and improved event logging and diagnostic capabilities.</p>
                    <p>A typical upgrade requires only the installation of a new Main Electronic Cabinet (MEC) and an optional remote operator panel. The installation of most upgrades takes just a few days, minimizing the costly downtime associated with the installation of new gauging systems.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Features & Components</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Main Electronic Cabinet (MEC):</strong> Houses an LCD touchscreen, high-speed processors, flash drives, and industry-standard hardware.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advanced I/O:</strong> Includes 16-bit analog-to-digital channels and 48 channels of configurable digital I/O for reliable and accurate measurements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> A number of popular communication links are available, permitting seamless integration with existing automation systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliable Power:</strong> All power supplies are protected by circuit breakers and are monitored and alarmed for malfunctions. Color-coded wiring simplifies troubleshooting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> RSI system upgrades re-use the existing x-ray sources and measuring frames. Existing detector units are upgraded to meet today's demands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Future-Proof Design:</strong> Our hardware and software are designed to minimize future obsolescence issues, and we back everything up with a 10-year support guarantee.</li>
                    </ul>
