                    <h2>In-House Manufactured X-Ray Sources</h2>
                    <p>At the core of our gauging systems are high-powered X-ray sources developed and built in-house. This allows us to monitor and control the complete manufacturing process, ensuring the highest quality and stability. By placing high-voltage components inside the source housing, we eliminate troublesome high-voltage cables and connectors, leading to more reliable, trouble-free operation for many years.</p>
                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Long-life, liquid-cooled sources for hot and cold mill applications.</li>
                        <li>Available in 50kV, 100kV, 160kV, and 250kV.</li>
                        <li>Heavy-duty housings with integral cooling passages provide superior thermal stability.</li>
                        <li>Typical lifetime of 4-5 years, ensuring long-term value.</li>

                    <h2>Advanced X-Ray Detectors</h2>
                    <p>RSI utilizes Ion Chamber Detectors for their superior physical attributes and performance in severe environments. They are rugged, thermally stable, and shock-resistant. A key advantage is their lack of "dark current," which provides virtually zero "hysteresis" and allows for a quick recovery from excessive X-ray exposure ("blinding"), unlike other detector technologies.</p>
                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Optimum stability in severe environments with superior shock and vibration resistance.</li>
                        <li>Fast response times, typically 2-3 milliseconds.</li>
                        <li>Ultra-fast 0.5 millisecond ion chambers available for high-speed applications like cold mill chatter detection.</li>
                        <li>High-pressure, low-noise Xenon gas-filled Ion chambers for critical hot mill use.</li>
