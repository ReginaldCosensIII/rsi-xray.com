            <h2>The DMC Legacy</h2>
            <p>RSI carries forward a rich heritage from the pioneers of the gauging industry. Our lineage traces back to DMC (Data Measurement Corporation), a key innovator in thickness and coating measurement. When DMC was acquired, its key personnel brought their expertise to RSI, continuing the mission of providing robust, reliable gauging solutions.</p>
            <p>Today, RSI is the undisputed industry leader in support and system upgrades for legacy DMC and Radiometrie systems. We are committed to ensuring that these powerful, long-lasting systems continue to perform for our clients, preserving their investment and maximizing their operational efficiency.</p>
