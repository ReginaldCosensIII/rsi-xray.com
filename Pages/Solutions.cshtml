      <h2>Upgrade & Modernize Legacy Systems</h2>
      <p>The evolution of technology has rendered many gauge computers obsolete, while the frames and sensors remain viable.
 An <strong><a asp-page="/Products/UpgradePackage">RSI Upgrade Package</a></strong> makes your aging gauge perform better than new for a fraction of the cost.
 We reuse existing radiation sources and measuring frames, and can often upgrade detector units, reducing spare parts costs.
 Most upgrades require only a new Main Electronic Cabinet (MEC) and can be completed in just a few days, minimizing downtime.
 We offer flexible upgrade solutions for many legacy systems, including those from <strong>DMC, Radiometrie, Loral, Weston, Accuray, Thermo Fisher,</strong> and more.</p>

      <h2>Safer, More Accurate Technology Replacement</h2>
      <p>Many facilities still use older radioisotope systems that rely on sources like Americium-241, which are becoming less desirable due to significant safety and environmental concerns.
 Our expertise in <strong>X-ray Gauging</strong> allows us to not only provide a modern cost-effective, more accurate replacement but also a replacement that is both safer for your team and the environment.
 Our <strong><a asp-page="/Products/ThicknessGauges" asp-fragment="model-50">Model 50 X-ray Gauge</a></strong> delivers superior performance with faster response and larger air gaps, completely eliminating the risks associated with radioactive materials.</p>

        <h3>System Specifications & Features</h3>
        <p>This custom quality control instrument was designed for product sampling of various 
 coatings on carbon and stainless steel substrates.</p>
        <h4>Process & Application</h4>
        <p>To ensure final product quality, this Lab Coating Gauge provides precise offline analysis.
 After our automated online gauges control the coating thickness during production, random samples are taken from the coil.
 This instrument is then used for the critical quality control step of verifying the coating weight and generating valuable statistical data.</p>
        <h4>Application Data:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Coating Types:</strong> Measures Zinc, Galvanneal, Al-Zn (ZAM®), and Aluminum Types 1 &amp;
 2.</li>
          <li><strong>Substrate Thickness:</strong> 0.35 to 3.5 Millimeters.</li>
          <li><strong>Coating Weights:</strong> Measures Zinc up to 1.4 oz./ft.² and Galvanneal up to 0.6 oz./ft.².</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Components:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gauge Processor:</strong> Ubuntu (Linux) RTOS with Compact Flash Drive.</li>
          <li><strong>Operator Display:</strong> 17"
 touchscreen for configuration, diagnostics, and operation.</li>
