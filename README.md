# RSI Website Rebuild – Backend (ASP.NET Core 8)

This repository contains the secure, modern backend implementation for the RSI (Radiometric Services & Instruments, LLC) website rebuild project, replacing a legacy Classic ASP infrastructure. The backend is built using ASP.NET Core 8 Razor Pages and designed to support secure form submissions, branded email notifications, reCAPTCHA validation, and modular page templating.

The backend is tightly integrated with a responsive frontend and emphasizes **security**, **SEO**, **performance**, and **lead generation**.

🔐 **Production readiness**: Nearing completion. Pending SMTP finalization, branded emails, and final deployment settings.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

> ⚠️ This is a backend-only project. Frontend HTML/CSS/JS assets are authored separately and merged at publish time.

### Development

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "Smtp:Host" "smtp.example.com"
dotnet run
```

Navigate to: `https://localhost:5001`

### Publishing for IIS

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
```

Then:

- Copy `./publish` to IIS-bound directory
- Ensure app pool user has read/execute permissions
- Configure site binding for domain (e.g., `test.rsi-xray.com`)

### Production

- Store SMTP & Recaptcha keys in Environment Variables
